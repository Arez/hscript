Hola Unblocker HScripts
===

### Introduction:

  * An "HScript", or Hola Script, is a list of routing instructions for a set of URLs (e.g. routing rules for www.g*.com)
  * For example, an HScript may instruct Hola that all requests for Facebook.com originating in China will be routed through non-Chinese IPs in order to allow Chinese residents to see Facebook despite the Chinese Firewall, or may instruct Hola to route all requests to yoursite.com to be routed through IPs in Germany to see how your site looks to a German user
  * You can create HScripts or HScript Packages (Packages are simply a list of HScripts, e.g. "Social sites Package" would include a set of HScripts for rerouting requests to Facebook.com and Twitter.com, etc)
  * You can share your HScripts and HScript Packages for others to use with their Hola

### Creating your HScript:
  * Look at our HScript samples:
   1. On our Github page: https://github.com/HolaScripts, or
   2. By pressing the 'View Script' on top of any of the Scripts in the Hola Unblocker settings webpage
   3. Search the web for "Hola Scripts" or "HScripts" + keywords, e.g. "Social sites HScripts"
  * Copy a sample Script whose functionality resembles your desired HScript, and modify it to your needs
  * Create an HScript Package by including several rules within one HScript

### Sharing your HScripts:
  * We recommend that you open your own Github or similar repository for all the HScripts and HScript Packages you create
  * A Hola user that wants to use an HScript that you wrote just needs to click on the link you provided for that HScript (which you received from the Hola Unblocker settings webpage when you submitted it), and it is then automatically added to their Hola Unblocker configuration
  * The user can remove the HScript at any time from his their Unblocker settings by pressing "delete" at the top of the site rule

Good luck!
The Hola team
