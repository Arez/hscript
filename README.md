Introduction:
-------------
- A "Hola Script" is a list of routing instructions for a set of URLs (e.g. routing rules for www.g*.com)
- For example, a Hola Script may instruct Hola that all requests for facebook.com originating in China will be routed through non-Chinese IPs in order to allow Chinese residents to see facebook despite the Chinese firewall, or may instruct Hola to route all requests to yoursite.com to be routed through IPs in Germany to see how your site looks to a German user
- You can write Hola Scripts, or Hola Script Packages (e.g. a "Social sites Package" that includes Scripts for rerouting requests to facebook.com and twitter.com) and share them with others for their use
- You can then share your Script for others to use with their Hola
- You can also create a "Hola Script Package" which is a list of Hola Scripts (e.g. a "Social sites Package" that includes Hola Scripts for facebook.com and twitter.com)

Creating your Hola Script:
--------------------------
- Look at Hola Script samples:
   1. At our Github page: https://github.com/HolaScripts, or
   2. By pressing the 'View Script' on top of any of the Scripts in the Hola user interface
   3. Search the web for "Hola Scripts"
- Copy a sample Script who's functionality resembles your desired Script, and modify it to your needs
- You can create a Hola Script Package by including several rules within one Script

Sharing your Hola Scripts:
-------------------------
- We recommend that you open your own Github or similar repository for all the Hola Scripts and Packages you write
- A Hola user that wants to use a Hola Script that you wrote clicks on the link you provide to that Script (which you receive from Hola user interface when you submit it), and it is then integrated into his Hola service
- The user can then remove the Script from his user interface by pressing "delete" at the top of that rule

Good luck!
